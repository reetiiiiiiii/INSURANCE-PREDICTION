# INSURANCE-PREDICTION
Tool used- Jupyter notebook.
I collected data of different people according to their age and choice of taking insurance and then created a model using Sklearn library in python which predicts their choice.
I split the data into two parts using train_test_split() which i used for training and testing.
Then i applied logistic Regression in this model.
